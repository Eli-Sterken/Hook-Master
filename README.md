# Url Comming Soon

Welcome to the Hook Master GitHub repository! Hook Master is a tool for easaly internacting
with Discord webhooks. A Discord webhook is a bot that can post content in a channel. You can send the content
to the webhooks URL. You can learn more about webhooks [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). This tool can send messages and embeds through webhooks, change their avatar, spam them, attach files, delete them, and much more!

## How It Works

This site has no backend; it only sends requests to your webhook url. The UI is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com). It also uses Typescript for a better developent experince.

## File Structure

This project follows the basic file strucutre for Nuxt apps, but here are a few key files
and folders:

- public
  - The folder for all public static assets
  - favicon.ico
    - The site icon
- components
  - The folder for all .vue component files
  - Footer.vue
    - The site footer component
  - Modal.vue
    - Custom modal component
- app.vue
  - The main page file.
- types.ts
  - Typescript custom types, mainly for the modal system.

## Notes

1. I will add the inital code soon, I just started this project :)

# Have Fun!
